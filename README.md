### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am a MERN stack developer and also know C++ and Python. I enjoy competitive programming as well( seeing that green checkmark is one of the purest pleasures in life ). I am also an avid reader so feel free to drop some suggestions!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting ideas that make my gears turn!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JS, pathfinding algorithms and ReactJS
